# Meta-Tunes

A music player app created using MERN STACK </br>
With this app, users can now enjoy a personalized music experience like never before. They have the freedom to like their favorite songs and curate their own playlists, all within a sleek and user-friendly interface. But that's not all! I have also implemented an innovative feature that allows users to choose between private and public playlists.</br>
By offering the option for public playlists, my app fosters a vibrant community of music lovers who can discover and explore new songs together. It's incredible how music can connect people from all walks of life, and I wanted to harness that power through my app. Now, users can not only enjoy their own playlists but also share their musical tastes with the world!</br>
Powered by the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), my app ensures a seamless and efficient music streaming experience. From robust data management to real-time updates, this full-stack approach guarantees top-notch performance and scalability</br>
